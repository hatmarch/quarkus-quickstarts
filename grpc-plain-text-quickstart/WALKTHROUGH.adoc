= Quarkus gRPC, imperative and reactive, and live reload demo

== Quarkus gRPC

In this section we want to show the `.proto` file and the `.pom` and how these work together to generate familiar gRPC services (but with the `mutiny` twist)

. In VSCode, show the project structure
. Use kbd:[CMD+p] to quickly open `helloworld.proto`
. Show the Service and messages
. Use kbd:[CMD+p] to quick open `pom.xml`
** Show the quarkus-grpc extension
** Show mutiny extension
** Show the quarkus maven plugin
** Show the `generate-code` goal
. Open a terminal to run the following command to generate code
+
----
mvn compile
----
+
. Highlight the following line
+
----
[INFO] --- quarkus-maven-plugin:2.1.4.Final:generate-code (default) @ grpc-plain-text-quickstart ---
----
+
. Go to the file explorer and show the code generated in the `target\generated-sources\grpc\examples` directory
+
image::generated-src.jpg[]
+
. Use kbd:[CMD+p] to quickly open `HelloWorldService.java` and point out all the red highlights
+
image::hello-world-service.jpg[]
+
. Use kbd:[CMD+click] on the `GreeterImplBase` to show the generated file that the service extends

== Quarkus live-reload

In this section we use `grpcurl` to call our service.  We show how live reload catches edits to our service without the need of reloading

. If you haven't already, make sure you have a split terminal in vscode
. [red]#Make sure `HelloWorldService.java` is open when you run this#
. Start up quarkus with 
+
----
mvn quarkus:dev
----
+
. Potentially point out the `generate-code` goal as it starts up
. Point out the different ports as they open (particularly port 9000 if it comes up)
+
image::ports.jpg[]
+
. Show the quarkus startup and the installed features
+
image::features.jpg[]
+
. In terminal 2 run the following to call the endpoint
+
----
grpcurl --plaintext -d '{"name": "World!"}' localhost:9000 helloworld.Greeter/SayHello
----
+
You should get a `HelloReply`
+
----
{
  "message": "Hello World!",
  "count": 1
}
----
+ 
. Now edit the string "Hello " and replace with "Why hello there "
. Run grpcurl again
+
----
grpcurl --plaintext -d '{"name": "World!"}' localhost:9000 helloworld.Greeter/SayHello
----
+
. Notice Quarkus recompile
+
image::reload.jpg[]
+
. And a new message is returned:
+
----
{
  "message": "Why hello there World!",
  "count": 2
}
----

== Quarkus Endpoint and gRPC consumption

In this section we want to show imperative and reactive side by side by debugging into the app

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure `mvn quarkus:dev` is running in the background before starting this section
====

. Use kbd:[CMD+p] to quickly open `HelloWorldEndpoint.java`
. Point out the `javax.ws` annotations
. Point out the `@GrpcClient` annotation
** Notice that each points to a different stub
+
[TIP]
====
Use kbd:[CMD+click] to jump into the stub 

Use kbd:[CTRL+-] to navigate backwards to the `HelloWorldEndpoint.java`
====
+
. Split the window and open `application.properties` to the side and show the `host` property
+
----
quarkus.grpc.clients.hello.host=localhost
----
+
. Place breakpoints in each function
. Start the debugger with `Debug (Attach)`
. Switch desktops to Chrome
. Navigate to the blocking endpoint
+
----
http://localhost:8080/hello/blocking/canva
----
+
. You should switch to VSCode, continue through the debugger
+
. Switch back to Chrome desktop and navigate to mutiny
+
----
http://localhost:8080/hello/mutiny/canva
----
+
. Back in VSCode continue the debugger twice
. Switch back to Chrome to show the result:
